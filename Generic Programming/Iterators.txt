Iterators
Iterators as an entity that helps us to access the data within a container with certain restrictions

Input Iterators: A entity through which you can read data from container and move ahead. Eg- keyboard

Output Iterators: A entity through which you can wrte into the container and move ahead.

Forward Iterators: Iterator with functionalities of input and output interator in single direction. Eg- Singly Linked List

Bidirectional Iterators: Forward Iterator that can move in both directions

Random Access Iterators: Random Access Iterator is an iterator that can read/write in both directions and also can take jumps.

Why Learn Iterators?
We want to make generic algorithms with freedom from underlying data structure.
Eg- We made Search() functio to work on all data-types using Templates
Now we can make search() Function to work on all types of containers using iterators.
