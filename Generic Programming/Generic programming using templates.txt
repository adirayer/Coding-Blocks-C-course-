Generic programming using templates
 it can be done using two methods
 1. algorithm
 2. container(vector)


Containers IN STL

Sequence containers: implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner
	-vector
	-list
	-deque
	-arrays
	-forward_list

Container Adaptors: Provides a different interface for sequential containers.
	-queue
	-priority queue
	- stack

Associative Containers: Implement srted data structures that can be quickly searched(o(log n) complexity)
	-set
	-multiset
	-map
	-multimap

Unordered Associative Containers: Implement Unorderes data structures that can be  quickly searched
	-unordered set
	-unordered multiset
	-unordered map
	-unordered multimap
